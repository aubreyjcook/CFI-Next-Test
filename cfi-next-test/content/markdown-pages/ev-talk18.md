David McRaney will talk about how, in the process of writing a book about the science of why it’s so hard to change people's minds, he changed his own mind about how minds change. In this talk, you'll not only learn what works when it comes to persuading, debunking, and challenging conventions to disagreeing well, you'll learn why it is vitally important to understand why some of us saw that photo of a dress as black-and-blue and others as white-and-gold (because it answers a whole of questions about how much of modern discourse can seem impossibly polarized).
