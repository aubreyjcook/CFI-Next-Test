**Black Holes - The Most Confusing Objects in the Universe.**

Black holes have long confused and fascinated physicists and non-physicists alike. They are undoubtedly evocative objects - the imprint of stars that have collapsed without limit under their own gravity at the end of their lives. In the 1970s, a small group of physicists including Stephen Hawking and Jacob Beckenstein developed the field of black hole thermodynamics. Their work led to a series of paradoxes and challenges which catalysed a program of research that, 50 years later, has led us to suspect that space and time are not fundamental and may emerge from a deeper theory. In this talk I will review the current understanding of Black Holes - the most confusing objects in the Universe.
