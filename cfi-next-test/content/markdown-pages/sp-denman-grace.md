Grace Denman has been a leader in skeptical activism since cofounding the National Capital Area Skeptics (NCAS) in 1987. She has had the privilege of serving on the NCAS Board of Directors since its inception and has served as treasurer and president. She is retired from AccelerED, a subsidiary of the University of Maryland Global Campus, formerly the University of Maryland University College (itâ€™s complicated). She still questions assumptions daily.
