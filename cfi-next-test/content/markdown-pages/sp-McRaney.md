David McRaney is a journalist and lecturer fascinated with brains, minds, and culture. He created the blog, book, and ongoing podcast *You Are Not So Smart*, which he calls a "celebration of self delusion." His most recent book is *How Minds Change*, all about the nuances of communication and persuasion as well as the science behind how (and why) we do (and do not) update our understanding of the world (and ourselves) when faced with novel experiences, ambiguous information, challenging conversations, or a combination of all three. After finishing *How Minds Change*, he wrote, produced, and recorded a six-hour audio documentary exploring the history of the idea and the word _genius_, which is the subject of his next book.
