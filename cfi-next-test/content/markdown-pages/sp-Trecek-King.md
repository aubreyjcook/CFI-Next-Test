Melanie Trecek-King is the creator of *Thinking Is Power*—whose name is a riff on the old adage “knowledge is power”—which emphasizes learning the ability to find and use reliable information to make wiser decisions. *Thinking Is Power* uses accessible language and engaging graphics to demonstrate how to think, not what to think, and empowers learners to protect themselves from misinformation.

Trecek-King is an associate professor of biology at Massasoit Community College, where she teaches an award-winning science course designed to equip general-education students with essential critical thinking, information literacy, and science literacy skills.

An active writer, speaker, and consultant, Trecek-King loves to share her “teach skills, not facts” approach with other science educators and help schools and organizations meet their goals through better thinking.
