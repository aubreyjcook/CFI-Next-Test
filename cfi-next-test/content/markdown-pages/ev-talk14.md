In recent years, ideology has been creeping into evolutionary biology, distorting facts in a way that gives people a false impression of what nature is like. In this talk, I explore two of the many ways this ideological erosion of biology has infected the field. The first is the increasingly widespread claim that biological sex is a “spectrum”: that there are not just two sexes, male and female, but a large number of them. This may be true of _gender_ but not of biological sex itself, which is always binary, with just two sexes in all animals and vascular plants. Why has this distortion occurred? Probably to buttress the felt identities of people who are transsexual or non-binary. But this conflates sex and gender, and the sex binary, which has led to big advances in understanding evolution, should not be distorted in the service of ideology.

A similar phenomenon has occurred in biological discussions of _race_, though the term is fraught and I prefer to use _populations_. The popular argument that there are no meaningful genetic differences between human populations has led the American Medical Association, for instance, to state that “Race and ethnicity are social constructs without biological meaning.” This is in fact false: human populations over the globe have sufficient genetic differences that we can infer our ancestry with high accuracy—and even deduce one’s crude self-identified “race”—from a sample of DNA. These genetic differences evolved when early human populations lived in physical isolation, and have implications not just for deducing ancestry, but also tracing the history of human migration and for mitigating disparities in health and education. Again, the reason for the popular idea that race is nonexistent comes from a well-meaning desire to see nature as we would like it to be: with everyone in the world pretty much genetically identical.

But, in the end, we should not look to nature to buttress our ideology, politics, or morality, for this tactic not only distorts science, but also grounds our values on observations of biology rather than on the proper foundation—reason and humanism.
