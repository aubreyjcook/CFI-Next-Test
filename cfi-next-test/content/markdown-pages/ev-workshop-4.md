We are excited to announce that the Lilienfeld Alliance will be hosting its first half-day academic conference this year! We are calling it LiliCon. It will be held in conjunction with CSICon, Thurs Oct 24, 2024, 12-4pm, at the Horseshoe Las Vegas Resort and Casino. We hope to promote the scientific study of our work, to discover what is effective, and to promote it. Furthermore, we hope to build the strength of connections among academics who are working toward this end by providing an inspirational meeting of the minds.

We are soliciting two types of proposals:

1. **Scholarship of Teaching and Learning** - Research related to the teaching of rational skepticism in a higher education setting. Proposals must include data.

2. **Teaching Demonstration** - Description of a course focused on teaching rational skepticism, or an assignment, or an in-class activity. These must include some kind of audience-involved demonstration.

We will have both presentations and posters.

We hope that each of you will consider sharing your work, and help us solicit proposals from other scholars. A PDF of the call for proposals is attached. Feel free to share among your contacts and encourage students to submit as well.

Submit proposals by June 1. [https://forms.gle/KwUzaYVm9Bo4ERXC8](https://forms.gle/KwUzaYVm9Bo4ERXC8)
