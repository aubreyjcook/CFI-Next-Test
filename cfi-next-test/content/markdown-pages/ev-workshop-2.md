“The scientific mind does not so much provide the right answers as ask the right questions.”

—Claude Levi-Strauss (translated by John and Doreen Weightman from* Lu Cru et le Cuit*, 1964)

We like answers. We like to know them and give them. Sometimes we want others to think we are smart or knowledgeable, so we jump to give answers rather than ask questions. And the questions we do ask are sometimes more about our personal assumptions and biases than about getting to the real answer.

Good questions are a skeptic’s essential tools for finding good answers. In this participatory workshop, we will ask you to interact with us and fellow attendees to practice methods for posing questions that lead to better understanding and possibly rethinking ideas—maybe even your own.
