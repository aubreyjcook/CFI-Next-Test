Well, that depends on your definition of critical thinking. The term _critical thinking_ means different things to different people. Who is right? Science teachers are trained to teach critical thinking, emphasizing that science is falsifiable and requires tested hypotheses, evidence, and consensus. They encourage students to engage in the scientific process through NGSS practices and project-based learning.

But here’s what they don’t teach: how our own flawed thinking and perceptions can get in the way of accepting facts. They do not teach that many of the things we each believe are tied more closely to our identities than to any facts. This reality that our worldview affects how we process new information and that science is the best way to put guardrails in place so we can seek the truth in the most objective way possible should be an ongoing theme in our classrooms.
