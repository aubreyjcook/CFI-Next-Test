In this workshop, you’re getting two renowned skeptical investigators from opposite sides to the planet – in one workshop! First, Kenny will be dipping into his toolbox of strategies for solving mysteries, specifically tricks that people use to create viral videos that appear on TikTok and YouTube: ghosts that only appear in reflections, pets that disappear into thin air, objects moving on their own, demonic entities that appear when the lights turn off, and more. We’ll then take a look behind the scenes at how easily many of these videos are created and you’ll get a chance to make some yourself! Next, Richard Saunders will be joining in to teach us the tricks of Water Diving, Spoon Bending, and the miracle Power Balance Band. How these tricks are done, how people sell them to audiences, and what you can look for to expose the trickery.
