Daniel Simons is a professor of psychology, advertising, and business administration at the University of Illinois, where he heads the Visual Cognition Laboratory. His research explores the limits of awareness and memory, the reasons we often are unaware of those limits, and the implications of such limits for our personal and professional lives. He is best known for his research that shows people are far less aware of their visual surroundings than they think.
