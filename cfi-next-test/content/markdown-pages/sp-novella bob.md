Bob Novella cohosts the _Skeptics’ Guide to the Universe_ and _Alpha Quadrant 6_ podcasts. He also cowrote _The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe: How to Know What's Really Real in a World Increasingly Full of Fake_. He was also a primary contributor to the SGU’s second book, _The Skeptics’ Guide to the Future_. Novella’s scientific interests lie in the extremes, from the gargantuan to the infinitesimal: from cosmology and multi-verses to particle physics and quantum mechanics. He is especially fascinated by anticipated future technologies such as nanotechnology, artificial intelligence, and human augmentation.
