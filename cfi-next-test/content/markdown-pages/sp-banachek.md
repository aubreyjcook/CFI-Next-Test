Banachek was born in England on November 30, 1960. He was schooled in South Africa and the United States. It was while living in Port Elizabeth, South Africa, that Banachek saw his first magician at a high school function at the age of fourteen. He was intrigued but not enough to delve much further into that secret world. In 1976, the bicentennial year of the United States, Banachek moved to the U.S. It was at the end of this same year that he picked up a worn copy of James Randi’s book _The Truth about Uri Geller_. Banachek’s _Mind Games Live_ is in Las Vegas at the prestigious Strat hotel, Casino and Skypod.
