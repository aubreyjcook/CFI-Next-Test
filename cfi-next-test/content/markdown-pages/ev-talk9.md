The technologies under the umbrella of genetic engineering have provided everything from cheap cheese to COVID-19 vaccines to curing sickle cell disease. We are at a precipice where the newest technologies stand to drive incredible innovation in agriculture, medicine, and conservation. However, deployment of these technologies hinges on public acceptance. Those opposed to these technologies exploit social media to spread false information and break trust in genetic engineering, the companies that develop products, and the scientists that seek to educate a concerned public about them. Their goal is to vilify useful technology for political or ideological reasons; sadly even trusted organizations fall victim to promoting misinformation. While the pace of innovation is accelerating, the deployment of technology must navigate a formidable social hurdle. The scientific and skeptical communities play a central role in identifying legitimate concerns, while at the same time countering mis /disinformation before innovation may proceed to application. This presentation frames new technologies, the tactics used to defame them, and how you can participate in effective strategic communication to advance their acceptance.
