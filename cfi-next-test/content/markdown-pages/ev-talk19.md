In a society obsessed with commercial quick fixes and biohacking, the quest for healthy
aging and longevity has taken center stage. From dietary supplements and anti-aging
creams to wellness retreats and lifestyle programs, the market is saturated with
promises of eternal youth. But what do the experts say about the science of longevity?
Can pills, infrared saunas, and cryotherapy slow life’s relentless march toward entropy?
Has the first human to live to 150 already been born? Join Nick Tiller, Timothy Caulfield,
and Rina Raphael as they untangle the science and pseudoscience of longevity.
Through interactive polling and audience Q and A, the trio will dissect the claims of
“precision medicine,” delve into tech magnate Bryan Johnson’s quest for the fountain of
youth, and challenge conventional wisdom surrounding diet and exercise.
