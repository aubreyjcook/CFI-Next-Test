Natalia Pasternak is a Brazilian science writer and communicator. She holds a PhD in microbiology and writes for the Brazilian newspaper _O Globo_ and the UK magazine _The Skeptic_. She brought crucial, lifesaving scientific information to millions of people in Brazil during the COVID-19 pandemic through her press columns, books, and radio and TV appearances. She is also a professor of science communication and policy at the School of International and Public Affairs at Columbia University and the president of _Instituto Questão de Ciência_ (Question of Science Institute), a Brazilian nonprofit organization dedicated to the promotion of scientific evidence in public policies. In 2021, the BBC listed her among the 100 most influential women of the year. Her award-winning books—including _Science in Everyday Life_, _Against Reality_, and _What Nonsense!_—have topped Brazil’s bestseller lists.
