#### LiliCon

LiliCon is a half day of short presentations on the topic of how to best teach critical thinking as it relates to rational skepticism by university scholars and instructors. Come learn what we know about best practices that allow students to learn the difference between science and pseudoscience, and how we use evidence to inform and improve our textbooks and teaching strategies.

#### Call for Papers

The Sunday Morning Papers session will recognize new voices and new ideas and showcase them in the spotlight of the CSICon stage. If you have had success in communicating scientific skepticism, teaching critical thinking, combating pseudoscience, or furthering the mission of CSI in some new and significant way, we want to hear from you!
