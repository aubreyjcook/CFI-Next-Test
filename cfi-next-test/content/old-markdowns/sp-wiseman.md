Richard Wiseman has been described by Elizabeth Loftus (past president, Association for Psychological Science) as “one of the world’s most creative psychologists.” His books (including _The Luck Factor_, _59 Seconds_ and _Paranormality_) have sold over three million copies worldwide, and his psychology-based YouTube videos have attracted over 500 million views. He holds Britain’s only Professorship in the Public Understanding of Psychology at the University of Hertfordshire, is one of the most followed psychologists on Twitter, and the _Independent on Sunday_ chose him as one of the top 100 people who make Britain a better place to live. Wiseman is a member of the highly exclusive Inner Magic Circle and has published over 100 academic papers (including those on magic and illusion). His most recent book is coauthored with legendary illusionist David Copperfield and explores the history of magic.
