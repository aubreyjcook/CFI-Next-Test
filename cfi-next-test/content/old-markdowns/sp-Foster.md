Dr. Joe Schwarcz is Director of McGill University’s “Office for Science and Society” which has the mission of separating sense from nonsense. He teaches both in the faculty of Science and the Faculty of Medicine and is the recipient of numerous awards for teaching chemistry and for interpreting science for the public. He was the first non-American to win the American Chemical Society’s prestigious Grady-Stack award for popularizing chemistry. “Dr Joe” has hosted a radio show on science for forty-three years, has appeared hundreds of times on television, writes a regular newspaper column and is the author of nineteen best-sellers. He has been awarded four honorary doctorates and teaches a course on “Food and Nutrition” that with 2700 students holds the record for the largest enrolment for any university course in Canada. Professor Schwarcz is also an amateur magician, often spicing up his presentations with a little magic.
