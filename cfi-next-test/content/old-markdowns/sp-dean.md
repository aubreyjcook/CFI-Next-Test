With an average of ninety-five minutes per day spent by each user on social media apps such as TikTok, social media has become the “new TV.” Psychics have found an easy way to reach and influence millions of people (including the young and impressionable) with their self proclaimed “abilities.”

Fame and fortune can be found by charlatans more easily than ever before in this new age. Hashtags such as #telekinesis, #witchtok, and #psychicmedium are on the rise with millions of views for each. But about three years ago, Dean started to battle these with #debunktok.

Dean uses his experience as a mentalist and magician to not only challenge these claims but to replicate and expose how these abilities are easily faked.
