Dave Farina is a science communicator and generalist best known for his YouTube channel, Professor Dave Explains (which has 2.5 million subscribers). While the channel is primarily a database of academic tutorials to help students with a variety of subjects, Dave is also passionate about neutralizing disinformation and science denial, from flat earthers and creationists to anti-vaxxers and medical hoaxes. Dave hopes to serve as a beacon toward the rehabilitation of public science literacy.
