Glenn Kessler has been editor and chief writer of The Fact Checker since 2011, making him one of the pioneers of political fact-checking.

He was The Washington Post’s chief State Department reporter for nine years, traveling around the world with three secretaries of state.

He joined the Post in 1998 from Newsday, where he was part of two reporting teams that won Pulitzer Prizes in spot reporting.
