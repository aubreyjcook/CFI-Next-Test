David Robert Grimes is a physicist, cancer researcher, and author. His work encompasses everything from how tumors use oxygen to the impact of disinformation and conspiracy theory on public understanding.

He is a fellow of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry and received the 2014 John Maddox Prize for communicating science in the face of adversity. His first book, _Good Thinking: Why Flawed Logic Puts Us All at Risk and How Critical Thinking Can Save the World_ was described as an unstoppable page turner by Richard Dawkins. It is out now from Experiment Publishing.
